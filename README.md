# Express Js Task

_This task talked about creating a simple array of objects in your code to represent a list of todos, 
and each object should contain relevant information about a todo, such as a unique identifier, title, description, and completion status..._
<br><br>


## Tech Stack

Here are all the concepts that I've implemented in this task:

- Completing all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, starting with the following endpoints:
1. GET /todos: (to list all todos).
2. GET /todos/:id: (to show a single todo).
3. DELETE /todos/:id: (to delete a single todo).
4. POST /todos/:id: (to create a single todo).
5. PUT /todos/:id: (to update a single todo).

- Utilize HTTP Status Codes for each of HTTP requests.
- Serve Static Files Endpoint to list of todos API and displays them as an unordered list on the webpage.
